<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grape Harvesters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pivotal Striker</li><li>Trunk Shaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The grape harvesters market primarily features two types: pivotal strikers and trunk shakers. Pivotal strikers utilize a swinging arm mechanism to strike the grape vines, effectively dislodging grapes without damaging the plant. In contrast, trunk shakers employ a vibration system at the base of the vine to release clusters of grapes. Both methods enhance harvesting efficiency, but their suitability can vary based on vineyard layout, grape variety, and climatic conditions, influencing growersâ€™ choices in equipment.</p></p>
