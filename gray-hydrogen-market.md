<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gray Hydrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Gas Reforming</li><li>Coal Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gray hydrogen is primarily produced through natural gas reforming and coal processing. In natural gas reforming, methane is subjected to high temperature and pressure in the presence of steam, resulting in hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is the most common method. In contrast, coal processing, or gasification, involves converting coal into syngas, which is then processed to extract hydrogen. Both methods emit significant CO2, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, and highlight the need for cleaner hydrogen production technologies.</p></p>
